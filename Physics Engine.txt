1)A physics engine is computer software that provides
an approximate simulation of certain physical
 systems, such as rigid body dynamics (including 
collision detection), soft body dynamics, and fluid
 dynamics, for the use in the domains of computer
 graphics, video games and film.
2)Some physics libraries are matter.js, Ammo.js, 
cannon.js box2d, p2.js etc.
3)Video games have evolved over the years to become
more realistic. One reason for this could be that
 when objects move in video games, they seem to 
obey the laws of physics. The software that allows 
for this is called a physics engine.
